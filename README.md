The script "generate_initial_networks.r" was used to produce the 1000 initial networks used for the simulations.

Scripts begining by "simulations" correspond to scrips used to perform all the simulations. Simulations were splitted by values of competition coefficient ("c") to avoid to generate to heavy outputs. They were executede on a cluster.

Scripts begining by "Figure" correspond to scripts used to aanalyse results of the simulations, each script producing the results corresponding to the cited figure.
